OpenGL project that contains 11 loaded 3D models. These models are affected
by light sources (ambient, point, directional, and spot). Two additional unlit models
represent the two point lights in the scene. These light sources can be toggled, and 
the spot light moves with the camera's position and forward direction. 

The FOV of the camera can be changed by scrolling the mouse wheel.

Instanced Drawing/Rendering was not attempted.
